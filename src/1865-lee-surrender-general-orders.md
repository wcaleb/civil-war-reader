Head Qrs Army N Va\
[Appomattox Court House[^1]]

After four years of arduous service, marked by unsurpassed courage and
fortitude the Army of Northern Virginia has been compelled to yeild
[sic] to overwhelming numbers. I need not tell the survivors of so many
hard fought battles who have remained steadfast to the last, that I have
consented to this result from no distrust of them. But feeling, that
valor and devotion could accomplish nothing that would compensate the
loss that would attend the continuance of the contest---I determined to
avoid the useless sacrifice of those whose finest services have endeared
them to their countrymen. By the terms of the agreement Officers and men
can return to their homes and remain until exchanged. You[^2] will take
with you the satisfaction that proceeds from the consciousness of duty
faithfully performed, and I earnestly pray that a merciful God will
extend to you His blessing and protection---With unceasing admiration of
your constancy and devotion to your country, and a grateful remembrance
of your kind and generous consideration of myself, I bid you an
affectionate farewell.

R. E. Lee\
