abstract: |
     After the Civil War is ended, Jourdon Anderson, who had lived as a slave
     in Tennessee but moved to Ohio during the war, was contacted by his former
     enslaver, Patrick Henry Anderson, who invited him to return to Nashville
     and work on his farm. Anderson replied in an open letter that was first 
     published in the Cincinnati *Commercial* and later reprinted in *The Freedmen's
     Book,* published by abolitionist Lydia Maria Child in 1865.

Dayton, Ohio, August 7, 1865

To My Old Master, Colonel P.H. Anderson, Big Spring, Tennessee

Sir: I got your letter and was glad to find you had not forgotten Jourdon, and
that you wanted me to come back and live with you again, promising to do better
for me than anybody else can. I have often felt uneasy about you. I thought the
Yankees would have hung you long before this for harboring Rebs they found at
your house. I suppose they never heard about your going to Col. Martin's to
kill the Union soldier that was left by his company in their stable. Although
you shot at me twice before I left you, I did not want to hear of your being
hurt, and am glad you are still living. It would do me good to go back to the
dear old home again and see Miss Mary and Miss Martha and Allen, Esther, Green,
and Lee. Give my love to them all, and tell them I hope we will meet in the
better world, if not in this. I would have gone back to see you all when I was
working in the Nashville Hospital, but one of the neighbors told me Henry
intended to shoot me if he ever got a chance.

I want to know particularly what the good chance is you propose to give me.
I am doing tolerably well here; I get $25 a month, with victuals and clothing;
have a comfortable home for Mandy,---the folks here call her Mrs. Anderson),---and
the children---Milly, Jane and Grundy---go to school and are learning well; the
teacher says Grundy has a head for a preacher. They go to Sunday- School, and
Mandy and me attend church regularly. We are kindly treated; sometimes we
overhear others saying, "Them colored people were slaves" down in Tennessee.
The children feel hurt when they hear such remarks, but I tell them it was no
disgrace in Tennessee to belong to Col. Anderson. Many darkies would have been
proud, as I used to be, to call you master. Now, if you will write and say what
wages you will give me, I will be better able to decide whether it would be to
my advantage to move back again.

As to my freedom, which you say I can have, there is nothing to be gained on
that score, as I got my free papers in 1864 from the Provost- Marshal- General
of the Department of Nashville. Mandy says she would be afraid to go back
without some proof that you are sincerely disposed to treat us justly and
kindly; and we have concluded to test your sincerity by asking you to send us
our wages for the time we served you. This will make us forget and forgive old
scores, and rely on your justice and friendship in the future. I served you
faithfully for thirty-two years and Mandy twenty years. At twenty-five dollars
a month for me, and two dollars a week for Mandy, our earnings would amount to
eleven thousand six hundred and eighty dollars. Add to this the interest for
the time our wages has been kept back and deduct what you paid for our clothing
and three doctor's visits to me, and pulling a tooth for Mandy, and the balance
will show what we are in justice entitled to. Please send the money by Adams
Express, in care of V. Winters, Esq., Dayton, Ohio. If you fail to pay us for
faithful labors in the past we can have little faith in your promises in the
future. We trust the good Maker has opened your eyes to the wrongs which you
and your fathers have done to me and my fathers, in making us toil for you for
generations without recompense. Here I draw my wages every Saturday night, but
in Tennessee there was never any pay-day for the Negroes any more than for the
horses and cows. Surely there will be a day of reckoning for those who defraud
the laborer of his hire.

In answering this letter please state if there would be any safety for my Milly
and Jane, who are now grown up and both good-looking girls. You know how it was
with Matilda and Catherine. I would rather stay here and starve, and die if it
comes to that, than have my girls brought to shame by the violence and
wickedness of their young masters. You will also please state if there has been
any schools opened for the colored children in your neighborhood, the great
desire of my life now is to give my children an education, and have them form
virtuous habits.

P.S. ---Say howdy to George Carter, and thank him for taking the pistol from you
when you were shooting at me.

From your old servant,

Jourdon Anderson
