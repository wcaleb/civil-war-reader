CHAP. LX.–*An Act to confiscate Property used for Insurrectionary
Purposes.*

*Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled*, That if, during the present or
any future insurrection against the Government of the United States,
after the President of the United States shall have declared, by
proclamation, that the laws of the United States are opposed, and the
execution thereof obstructed, by combinations too powerful to be
suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, or by the
power vested in the marshals by law, any person or persons, his, her, or
their agent, attorney, or employee, shall purchase or acquire, sell or
give, any property of whatsoever kind or description, with intent to use
or employ the same, or suffer the same to be used or employed, in
aiding, abetting, or promoting such insurrection or resistance to the
laws, or any person or persons engaged therein; or if any person or
persons, being the owner or owners of any such property, shall knowingly
use or employ, or consent to the use or employment of the same as
aforesaid, all such property is hereby declared to be lawful subject of
prize and capture wherever found; and it shall be the duty of the
President of the United States to cause the same to be seized,
confiscated, and condemned.^[In this context, "condemn" means to
"adjudge or pronounce forfeited, as a prize of war, smuggled goods,
etc." (Oxford English Dictionary).]

SEC. 2. *And be it further enacted*, That such prizes and capture shall
be condemned in the district or circuit court of the United States
having jurisdiction of the amount, or in admiralty in any district in
which the same may be seized, or into which they may be taken and
proceedings first instituted.

SEC. 3. *And be it further enacted*, That the Attorney-General, or any
district attorney of the United States in which said property may at the
time be, may institute the proceedings of condemnation, and in such case
they shall be wholly for the benefit of the United States; or any person
may file an information with such attorney, in which case the
proceedings shall be for the use of such informer and the United States
in equal parts.

SEC. 4. *And be it further enacted*, That whenever hereafter, during the
present insurrection against the Government of the United States, any
person claimed to be held to labor or service under the law of any
State, shall be required or permitted by the person to whom such labor
or service is claimed to be due, or by the lawful agent of such person,
to take up arms against the United States, or shall be required or
permitted by the person to whom such labor or service is claimed to be
due, or his lawful agent, to work or to be employed in or upon any fort,
navy yard, dock, armory, ship, entrenchment, or in any military or naval
service whatsoever, against the Government and lawful authority of the
United States, then, and in every such case, the person to whom such
labor or service is claimed to be due shall forfeit his claim to such
labor, any law of the State or of the United States to the contrary
notwithstanding. And whenever thereafter the person claiming such labor
or service shall seek to enforce his claim, it shall be a full and
sufficient answer to such claim that the person whose service or labor
is claimed had been employed in hostile service against the Government
of the United States, contrary to the provisions of this act.

APPROVED, August 6, 1861.
