IN THE FIELD, SAVANNAH, GA., January 16th, 1865.

SPECIAL FIELD ORDERS, No. 15.

I. The islands from Charleston, south, the abandoned rice fields along
the rivers for thirty miles back from the sea, and the country bordering
the St. Johns river, Florida, are reserved and set apart for the
settlement of the negroes now made free by the acts of war and the
proclamation of the President of the United States.

II\. At Beaufort, Hilton Head, Savannah, Fernandina, St. Augustine and
Jacksonville, the blacks may remain in their chosen or accustomed
vocations---but on the islands, and in the settlements hereafter to be
established, no white person whatever, unless military officers and
soldiers detailed for duty, will be permitted to reside; and the sole
and exclusive management of affairs will be left to the freed people
themselves, subject only to the United States military authority and the
acts of Congress.  By the laws of war, and orders of the President of
the United States, the negro is free and must be dealt with as such.  He
cannot be subjected to conscription or forced military service, save by
the written orders of the highest military authority of the Department,
under such regulations as the President or Congress may
prescribe.  Domestic servants, blacksmiths, carpenters and other
mechanics, will be free to select their own work and residence, but the
young and able-bodied negroes must be encouraged to enlist as soldiers
in the service of the United States, to contribute their share towards
maintaining their own freedom, and securing their rights as citizens of
the United States. ...

III\. Whenever three respectable negroes, heads of families, shall desire
to settle on land, and shall have selected for that purpose an island or
a locality clearly defined, within the limits above designated, the
Inspector of Settlements and Plantations will himself, or by such
subordinate officer as he may appoint, give them a license to settle
such island or district, and afford them such assistance as he can to
enable them to establish a peaceable agricultural settlement.  The three
parties named will subdivide the land, under the supervision of the
Inspector, among themselves and such others as may choose to settle near
them, so that each family shall have a plot of not more than (40) forty
acres of tillable ground, and when it borders on some water channel,
with not more than 800 feet water front, in the possession of which land
the military authorities will afford them protection, until such time as
they can protect themselves, or until Congress shall regulate their
title.  The Quartermaster may, on the requisition of the Inspector of
Settlements and Plantations, place at the disposal of the Inspector, one
or more of the captured steamers, to ply between the settlements and one
or more of the commercial points heretofore named in orders, to afford
the settlers the opportunity to supply their necessary wants, and to
sell the products of their land and labor.

IV\. Whenever a negro has enlisted in the military service of the United
States, he may locate his family in any one of the settlements at
pleasure, and acquire a homestead, and all other rights and privileges
of a settler, as though present in person.  In like manner, negroes may
settle their families and engage on board the gunboats, or in fishing,
or in the navigation of the inland waters, without losing any claim to
land or other advantages derived from this system.  But no one, unless
an actual settler as above defined, or unless absent on Government
service, will be entitled to claim any right to land or property in any
settlement by virtue of these orders.

V. In order to carry out this system of settlement, a general officer
will be detailed as Inspector of Settlements and Plantations, whose duty
it shall be to visit the settlements, to regulate their police and
general management, and who will furnish personally to each head of a
family, subject to the approval of the President of the United States, a
possessory title in writing, giving as near as possible the description
of boundaries; and who shall adjust all claims or conflicts that may
arise under the same, subject to the like approval, treating such titles
altogether as possessory.  The same general officer will also be charged
with the enlistment and organization of the negro recruits, and
protecting their interests while absent from their settlements; and will
be governed by the rules and regulations prescribed by the War
Department for such purposes. ...

BY ORDER OF MAJOR GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN:
